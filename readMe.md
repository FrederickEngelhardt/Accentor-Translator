1.    This application acts as a translator from English
    to either accented English or a completely different language.
    Development was a mobile first approach.

2.  It utilizes:
    a)    18 APIs from http://funtranslations.com/
            Note: no keys required but drawback is 5 tries/hr per IP address

    b)    Bing's text to text translator API
            Note: key & token are required & 1000 pages of text per day

The goal of the website was to provide an English speaker a fun way to interact with language.

The website itself is simplistic and meant to be used only for translation.

          or accents you want to translate to.
    b)    Once they are selected you will see the name of the language/accent you selected
          in the menu head and translation box.
    c)    Simply type a sentence or more into the text box.
    d)    Click "translate button "
    e)    Text should translate into the directed language
